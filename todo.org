* General
** Create header with project mark, menu items, and github link
** Create footer with project credits and github link
* Entities
** Make this the index route
** The storage type, as discussed was misunderstood :) That is more like is this string a string or text in the migration (VARCHAR(200) or TEXT).
** There aren't a lot of listing and filtering options I care about at the outset here. Just a bog-standard list of entities seems good.
** Search filter and pager seems like enough to manage a large number of them.
*** We could extend the use of meta information for the definition in the long run if we need more meta on our entity types.
** I do like archive as an option. Especially since I'm considering whether a sidebar menu that always shows a nav menu of all your entity types would be a good thing. So you can get to creating content quickly. Then archive would be a way of removing old cruft from that list.
** Is the gear the way to modifying the entity or can you press the name?
* Alter Entity
** Each changed field gets a yellow tilde to indicate modified, new ones get a green plus
** Add button for "Save field changes" to trigger finalizing the migration and applying it under the hood
** Humanify the presentation of some options
*** Which options?
** Have an expandable section for constraints (gray out and explain if N/A because not first migration set) and one for Validation.
** Under Validation you can dig into adding a list of validations of different types.
*** Only show ones that apply for the field type too.
* Create Entity
** Almost identical to Alter Entity, but allows user to set slug and field/storage types
* Settings
** I'm guessing storage/failover storage are mostly thoughts about what kind of stuff could be in here which is fine.
** Defaults is interesting, I don't think we should provide those right away.
** Logging is definitely a good fit, especially for the standalone variant.
* Import/Export
