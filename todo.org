* Alter Entity
** Each changed field gets a yellow tilde to indicate modified, new ones get a green plus
** Have an expandable section for constraints (gray out and explain if N/A because not first migration set) and one for Validation.
** Under Validation you can dig into adding a list of validations of different types.
*** Only show ones that apply for the field type too.
