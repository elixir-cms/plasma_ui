# Plasma UI

Plasma UI is a Phoenix based user interface for manipulating entity types with the ecto_entity library.

**WARNING:** This is a work in progress that is still in very early stages. You probably shouldn't use it.


# Usage

This project uses the [nix package manager](https://nixos.org/guides/install-nix.html) along with a script, `run`, that provides the following commands:

```
# Setup project
./run setup

# Start development
./run dev

# Run Credo
./run credo

# Run tests
./run test

# Create a release
./run release
```

The local development server runs on [localhost:4001](https://localhost:4001).
